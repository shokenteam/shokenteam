# SHOKEN

**SHOKEN** is a professional non-custodial trading platform focused on real-time markets, transparent execution, and clean market structure.

We are building a unified trading terminal that brings together:
- Perpetual Futures
- Prediction Markets
- CLOB-based Spot Trading (coming soon)

All designed with a strong emphasis on **market mechanics, orderbooks, and execution clarity**.

### 🔹 Prediction Markets

## Core Principles

- **Non-Custodial by Design**  
  Users always control their funds.

- **Market-First Architecture**  
  Orderbooks, liquidity, and execution come first — not hype.

- **Developer-Grade Infrastructure**  
  Typed APIs, modular services, and clean separation of concerns.

- **Transparency Over Marketing**  
  What you see in the app is what is actually running.
